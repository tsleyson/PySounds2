PySounds2
=========

My Python ripoff of Mark Rosenfelder's Sound Change Applier, in its second iteration, with a GUI.

testPySounds2.py is the command line interface; it has a help screen. 
(An overly verbose one, but it's still there.)

PySoundsGUI.pyw is the GUI interface. It should be pretty 
self-explanatory (if not, let me know).

There are no unit tests (I hadn't discovered them yet when I wrote this) 
and things might not work. There are some features I never finished 
debugging, like negative environments.

I'm not going to put this code under official license. You can use and 
redistribute freely, but I'll ask that you add any modifications you 
make to this Git repository so I can see them.

No warranties. This is code from a time when I was even more immature 
than now, so it is overly commented and buggy.
